# Prisma

This directory contains your database schema & migrations.

Every time you modify `schema.prisma`, you need to run `yarn db:migrate` for your changes to take effect.

**Note:** See [`Prisma Docs`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client) and [PostgreSQL Setup Guide (macOS)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/postgres-sql-macos-setup) on how to get started.
